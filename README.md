# Contest - Convergence Tester

Contest is a convergence tester, specifically made to measure time spent without contact between two hosts (i.e time spent when the network is converging after a topology change).  
It's essentially glorified ping...

Made for a finals project testing speed of convergence for different routing protocols.

Written in Go.
